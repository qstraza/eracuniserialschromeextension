# eracuni Serials Chrome Extension
E-racuni.com extension to help you fill serial numbers quicker.

Paste or type (and press Go) in serial numbers seperated by 
comma or any whitespace (tab, newline, space) and they will 
be parsed and filled in into text fields on the left as expected. 
You can also enter sequental serials as such "ABC001-ABC010" 
and parser will fill them in as expected. Just make sure, 
Starting serial has the same total length as end and there 
can only be one - (dash) in total.
